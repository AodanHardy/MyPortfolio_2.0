    <div class="about-content">
      <p class="about-introduction">
        I’m Aodán, a graduate software engineer (First Class Hons, Ulster University) now building real-world products at
        <strong>Full Fat Things</strong>. I enjoy turning specs into shipped features, improving developer workflows, and learning by doing.
      </p>

      <h3 class="about-heading mt-4">Background</h3>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        I first got into programming by tinkering with Python tutorials and Pygame, making small games for fun. That curiosity pushed me to switch
        from business studies into computing and keep levelling up—first at NRC and then at Ulster. Along the way I picked up Linux basics,
        version control, and a habit of breaking problems into small, testable steps.
      </p>

      <h3 class="about-heading mt-4">University</h3>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        I graduated with a <strong>BSc (Hons) in Computer Science — First Class (75%)</strong>.
        My final-year project was an online blockchain voting system: Python counting algorithms, a Django web app, and Polygon RPC integration (graded 76%).
        Favourite modules included Algorithms &amp; Data Structures (93%), Computer Vision (80%), and Web App Development (78%).
      </p>

      <h3 class="about-heading mt-4">Now</h3>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        I’m a <strong>Software Engineer at Full Fat Things</strong>, contributing to client web apps and working across Drupal/Wagtail/React stacks with modern tooling
        (Git, CI/CD, containers). Before this, I interned at <strong>Magnite</strong> on the SSR/Insight reporting system—Java with Vert.x, refactors aligned to DB changes,
        JUnit tests, and Grafana dashboards.
      </p>

      <h3 class="about-heading mt-4">Tech I Use</h3>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        <strong>Languages:</strong> Java, Python, C++, C#, PHP, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL.
        <br>
        <strong>Frameworks/Tools:</strong> Django, React, Vert.x, JUnit, Docker, AWS, Grafana, Postgres/MySQL, Ansible, Drupal, Linux/Raspberry&nbsp;Pi.
      </p>

      <h3 class="about-heading mt-4">Goals &amp; Interests</h3>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        I’m focused on growing as a full-stack engineer—shipping reliable features, writing clearer tests, and improving performance/observability.
        Outside of work I read widely (history, science, politics, plus fiction), follow football and GAA, and spend time with family and friends.
