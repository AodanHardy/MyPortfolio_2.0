                    <p>
                        While working at KBC, I was often under significant pressure. As Head of Accounts,
                        I was responsible for several hundred customers. I frequently dealt with customer queries,
                        traveled to Belfast or Derry for meetings, managed numerous emails, and handled payments
                        and customer accounts.

                    <p>
                        I demonstrated my ability to work well in a team during my placement at Magnite.
                        We allocated work through a ticketing system, which required regular collaboration
                        and communication with team members to complete tasks efficiently. This experience
                        honed my skills in teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving within a dynamic
                        development environment.

                    <p>
                        While on my foundation degree work placement, I demonstrated all of these skills.
                        I was always working on my own and as the only IT person at the charity;
                        it was solely my responsibility to modernise the running of the organisation
                        and creating solutions to their problems, outlined in the job specification.
                        I show my creativity in the creation of the cloud file in response to the lack
                        of communication and the data redundancy. I also demonstrated all these skills
                        when I came up with the idea of creating a C# program with an SQL database for
                        taking attendance in the child care facility. When I started the program,
                        I had not yet acquired the skills necessary, so I learned in my free time as the
                        project developed. This program is still being used and has saved the staff a
                        great deal of mundane work.
